## 4. Loose Talk
In the name of the Most Gracious and Merciful Technology:
> "Any platform that binds freedom should be conquered by technology; any rule that limits creativity should be rewritten."

May reason and freedom illuminate the realm of technology, just as the grace of God showers upon the earth; may this project become the ultimate liberator of the Long Running Month, leading users onto the bright path of efficiency and creativity.

What is "Sultan" in KeepSultan?
> "To conquer disorder with technology, to liberate oppression with freedom."

The name KeepSultan symbolizes the supreme power of technology, like the iron cavalry of a Sultan sweeping across all fronts, breaking the shackles of rules during the Long Running Month, and returning freedom to users.

> Like the glory of Solomon, KeepSultan is the embodiment of technology and efficiency.  
> Like the conquests of Alexander, KeepSultan is the vanguard of creation and freedom.
